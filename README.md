## Description
Punk Hangman is a word guess game built with JavaScript. It incorporates a "punk" theme for visual, audio, and content presentation.

## Game Play
Attempt to guess the mystery word/band name by using letters on your keyboard.

## Goal
Correctly reveal the band name before running out of guesses. A sample of a song by the band will play if guessed correctly!

## Instructions
1. Press any key to start the game.
2. Press letters on your keyboard to guess that letter.
3. Correct guesses will be revealed on the screen. Incorrect guesses will add elements to the hangman drawing.
4. If the full band name is revealed a song will play! If too many incorrect letters are guessed you will lose!
5. Press any key to play again!

## Note
While the layout is fully mobile responsive, the gameplay relies on a keyboard and, thus, does not work on mobile.
